# Visualizations & Key Findings

This section presents the key visualizations developed in Power BI, along with concise interpretations that support the main findings from the analysis.

## 1. Weekly Seasonality in Device Usage

**Interpretation:**  
Device usage peaks on Wednesdays (2.4K), with strong engagement also on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays (all around 2.3K). The lowest activity is observed on Tuesdays (1.7K). This pattern suggests that mid-week and weekends are optimal periods for user engagement or promotional campaigns.

## 2. Monthly Usage Trends

**Interpretation:**  
There is a marked increase in average device usage from March to April, indicating seasonal factors (such as springtime activity) may boost user engagement. Bellabeat could leverage this trend for time-specific promotions.

## 3. User Activity Distribution

**Interpretation:**  
The distribution of average user activity shows a clear segmentation between highly active and less active users, suggesting the potential for targeted engagement strategies for each group.

## 4. Activity by Time of Day

**Interpretation:**  
Afternoon and night hours account for the highest levels of user activity (steps and calories burned), while mornings are less active. This insight can inform the timing of in-app notifications or feature releases.

## 5. Steps and Sleep Over Time

**Interpretation:**  
Daily variations in steps and sleep reveal patterns and possible correlations between physical activity and rest. Highlighting these trends to users could encourage healthy habits.

## 6. User Segmentation

**Interpretation:**  
The user base is split between "Active" and "Inactive" segments. This visual reinforces the need for differentiated marketing and retention approaches for each cohort.
